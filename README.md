This course is intended to be a hands-on introduction to the C programming language and will teach related low-level systems concepts. Since it only runs for 6 weeks, the course is very fast paced, and a high level of programming maturity is required. CS197C covers introductory C and draws on concepts from CS121 and CS187.

I encourage you to ask questions in class or if preferred, by email. The point of this class is for you to learn, not for me to lecture, I am always glad to stop and explain a vexing concept.

Each lecture will last for about 30 minutes. The remainder of the time will be open for students to begin work on their weekly worksheet and their weekly project.

Office hours are by appointment only. I don't have a private space. Hence, we could meet in Lobby / GRC Master space. Please schedule visits ahead of time.
