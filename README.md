# COMPSCI190C Course Home page Fall 2018
## Instructor : Abhishek Somani

This course is intended to be a hands-on introduction to the C programming language and will teach related low-level systems concepts. Since it only runs for 6 weeks, the course is very fast paced, and a high level of programming maturity is required. CS197C covers introductory C and draws on concepts from CS121 and CS187.

I encourage you to ask questions in class or if preferred, by email. The point of this class is for you to learn, not for me to lecture, I am always glad to stop and explain a vexing concept.

Each lecture will last for about 30 minutes. The remainder of the time will be open for students to begin work on their weekly worksheet and their weekly project.

Office hours are by appointment only. I don't have a private space. Hence, we could meet in Lobby / GRC Master space. Please schedule visits ahead of time.

## Grading

This class is a 1-credit P/F class. If you get a 65 or higher you will "Pass" and it will not affect your GPA. If you receive a lower grade, 1 credit point of a zero will be averaged into your GPA.

### 30% - Class Exercises

Usually we will begin class with an example program for you to type into the computer, compile & run. In this workshop time, we will discuss concepts. You will receive full credit if your program compiles and runs by the midnight the following week.


### 30% - Worksheets

Your worksheet assignments will be C files that are partially created by me. By filling out the function definitions and blocks you will be able to edit and get full credit on these files. These are also due midnight the following week.

### 40% - Projects

Starting Week 4, you will begin work on a small project. We will work on selecting one or two appropriate projects together. You will not be able to work in groups or to use any projects from other classes (i.e., CS230) for these projects. You will either do 1 medium sized project (40pts) or 2 small projects (20 pts each).

## Where are the slides?

This class is not a puzzle where you decode the slides and shuffle them into the assignments. The code itself will be your resource, and you are encouraged to use high quality resources on the internet to help in certain circumstances. I may occasionally present slides, but I find them to be a poor method of learning new programming languages: you're only likely to learn new syntax, ideas, and concepts if you put them to use.
